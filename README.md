Team: USC Yellow Team

Purpose: To create a 2-player, gesture-based sword game that would be accessible to the visually-impaired. 

Description: SwordMaster is a 2-player SwordFighting mobile game that involves real-time gesture in the style of a Wii Remote game. Instead of relying on only touchscreen controls, the player will be able to move their phone around in a way that resembles the movements of actual swordfighting. Complete with sound effects, vibration, and audio prompting, SwordMaster is a fun, accessible game for those with and without visual impairments.

Gestures: 
- Right Slash (Hold your phone and move your arm from the right direction): Attack your opponent from the right! They will hear the sound of your sword approaching them.
- Left Slash (Hold your phone and move your arm from the left direction): Attack your opponent from the left! They will hear the sound of your sword approaching them.
- Move Forward (Drag your finger up along the screen to make your character walk foreward): Approach your opponent!
- Move Backwards (Pull your finger down along the screen to make your character walk backwards): Retreat!

Features:
- Server/Client connection (Can be playable by people in different locations).
- Gesture3D: Able to recognize and process Wii-Remote like movements.
- AudioPrompt: Guidance to caliberate screen and begin duels.
- Sound/Touch Effects: Hear and feel the battle!
